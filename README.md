# Home Automation System with Arduino and NodeMCU

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a simple yet effective home automation system using Arduino, NodeMCU ESP8266, and the Blynk mobile app. The system allows users to control home devices remotely, monitor environmental conditions, and enhance energy efficiency. 

## Features
- **Remote Control:** Control devices from anywhere using the Blynk app.
- **Sensor Integration:** Real-time data collection with various sensors.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Automate and optimize device operations.
- **Customization:** Personalize the user interface and automate specific tasks.
- **Scalability:** Expand the system by adding more devices.

## Components Required
- **NodeMCU ESP8266:** The main microcontroller for Wi-Fi connectivity.
- **Arduino UNO:** Optional, used for additional control and sensor integration.
- **Blynk App:** A mobile app for controlling the devices.
- **Sensors:** Such as DHT11 for temperature and humidity, PIR for motion detection.
- **Relays:** To control home appliances like lights and fans.
- **Power Supply:** 5V/3.3V power supply for the NodeMCU.

## Getting Started

### 1. **Hardware Setup**
   - **Connect NodeMCU ESP8266** to your home Wi-Fi network.
   - **Wire the sensors and relays** to the NodeMCU according to your home setup.
   - **Upload the code** to NodeMCU using the Arduino IDE.

### 2. **Software Setup**
   - **Download the Blynk App** from Google Play Store or Apple App Store.
   - **Create a new project** in the Blynk App and note the Auth Token.
   - **Configure the app** with widgets to control the devices (e.g., buttons, sliders).
   - **Install the Blynk Library** in the Arduino IDE and configure the code with your Wi-Fi credentials and Auth Token.

### 3. **Programming NodeMCU**
   - **Install Arduino IDE** and add the ESP8266 board in the board manager.
   - **Download and modify the code** from this repository.
   - **Upload the code** to NodeMCU via the Arduino IDE.

### 4. **Running the System**
   - **Power up the NodeMCU** and connect it to your home network.
   - **Use the Blynk app** to control and monitor your devices.
   - **Monitor sensor data** and receive notifications via the Blynk app.

## How to Customize
- **Add New Devices:** Expand the system by adding more sensors or relays and updating the code accordingly.
- **Integrate with Voice Assistants:** Use Alexa or Google Assistant for voice control by linking with IFTTT.
- **Data Logging:** Implement data logging using Blynk's data streaming feature for historical analysis.

## Troubleshooting
- **Connection Issues:** Ensure the NodeMCU is properly connected to the Wi-Fi network and check the Auth Token in the code.
- **Sensor Readings:** Verify the sensor connections and ensure they are compatible with the NodeMCU's voltage levels.
